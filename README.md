# LaTeX templates

Style and examples TeX files for LaTeX documents.

- My presentation style is based on the [Metropolis theme](https://github.com/matze/mtheme).
- My poster style is based on the [Gemini theme](https://github.com/anishathalye/gemini).
In addition to `poster.sty` and the preamble of `poster.tex`, you need to download `beamergeminitheme.sty`.
