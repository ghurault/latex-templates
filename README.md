# LaTeX templates

Style (`.sty`) and examples TeX (`.tex`) files for LaTeX documents.

- My presentation style is based on the [Metropolis theme](https://github.com/matze/mtheme).
- My poster style is based on the [Gemini theme](https://github.com/anishathalye/gemini).
In addition to `poster.sty` and the preamble of `poster.tex`, `beamergeminitheme.sty` is required.
- My report style is my own.
